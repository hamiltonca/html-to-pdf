# html-to-pdf
This is a repo that contains a node js project to convert HTML to PDF
The current implementation is using puppeteer to generate the pdf
Since the full puppeteer is in use, it can't be used with an AWS lambda.
This version should be deployable as an Elastic Beanstalk (or other cloud node instance).
